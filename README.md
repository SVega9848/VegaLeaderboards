# VegaLeaderboards

VegaLederboards is a plugin that allows you to make floating texts with different types of leaderbords (kills and deaths). It's also 100% personalizable! You can edit everything! From the first line, to the last line of the floating texts, being able to change the colors with few commands in-game!

When a player dies or a player kills other person, the floating texts update :smiley:

This is how it looks like in the way i edited it! You can use your imagination to make the best leaderbaords style!

## Commands & Setup

This is the command list:
```yaml
  - leaderboards spawn [kills/deaths]
  - leaderboards remove [kills/deaths]
  - leaderboards edit [kills/deaths]
  - leaderboards help
```

After using the edit command, you join into an edit system through the chat where you can modify the floating texts. These are the commands to edit them:
```yaml
  - firstline [text]
  - top1 [text]
  - top2 [text]
  - top3 [text]
  - topbelow3 [text]
  - finalline [text]
  - limit [number]
  - help
```
If you want to use colors use &. There are also certain codes to use in the edit mode like {PLAYER}, {KILLS}, {DEATHS} and {POSITION} (this one only for topbelow3)

## Permissions

The only permission this plugin has is:
```yaml
  - vegaleaderboards.cmd -> Allows you to use the command
```
